## 🚀 Who I Am

With a strong foundation in both **architecture design** and **hands-on software development**, I craft end-to-end solutions tailored to solve complex business challenges. My mission is to bridge the gap between development, operations, and business goals through robust, secure, and scalable platforms.

🔹 Over the years, I've led the development of mission-critical applications, including:

- ⚙️ **Logistics & Fulfillment Systems** — Real-time order tracking, inventory control, and dispatch management.
- 🛠️ **Contact Center Platforms** — Multi-channel communication tools, autodialers, and CRM integration.
- 🧠 **Human Resource Management (HRM)** — Streamlined employee lifecycle, payroll, and performance tracking.
- 🏢 **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)** — Smart stock control, product movement tracking, and location-based inventory logs.

## 🏗️ My Role in Every Project

As a **Solutions Architect**, I:
- Design scalable architectures for web and enterprise platforms.
- Ensure reliability, performance, and security in every system blueprint.

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I:
- Automate CI/CD pipelines, monitor systems, and optimize cloud deployments.
- Manage Linux servers, cloud infrastructure (DigitalOcean, AWS), and containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).

As a **Software Engineer**, I:
- Build backend APIs (Laravel, Node.js), frontend interfaces (Vue.js, React), and manage complex databases.
- Continuously test, optimize, and improve systems for high availability and fault tolerance.
